Customize Minecraft's day/night cycle and experience smoother nights with this lightweight Paper plugin!

## ✨ Features

- **🕒 Configurable Day & Night Lengths**  
  Set the duration of Minecraft's day and night in **minutes** via the config. Accepts decimal values for precise timings (e.g., `0.5` for 30 seconds).

- **🌙 Fast-forward Night While Sleeping**  
  Instead of instantly skipping the night, time will **smoothly accelerate** when enough players sleep, creating a more immersive experience.

- **⚙️ Easy-to-Use Config**  
  All values are adjustable in the `config.yml` file:
  ```yaml
  # Length of the daytime cycle in minutes
  dayLengthMinutes: 10.0

  # Length of the nighttime cycle in minutes
  nightLengthMinutes: 10.0

  # Enable or disable night fast forwarding when enough players sleep
  enableNightFastForward: true
  
  # Length of night fast forwarding in seconds
  nightFastForwardSeconds: 5.0

## ⚡ Usage

- The plugin works **automatically** once installed.

- Sleeping mechanics are replaced with the fast-forward system. Players no longer instantly skip the night.

- Config values are flexible, so you can create ultra-short or ultra-long days and nights.
