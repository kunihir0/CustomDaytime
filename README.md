A lightweight Paper plugin to customize the duration of Minecraft's day and night cycles.

## Features

- **Configurable Day & Night Lengths:** Set the duration of Minecraft's day and night in minutes via the config. Accepts decimal values for precise timings (e.g., `0.5` for 30 seconds).

## Configuration

All values are adjustable in the `config.yml` file:

```yaml
# Length of the daytime cycle in minutes
dayLengthMinutes: 10.0

# Length of the nighttime cycle in minutes
nightLengthMinutes: 10.0
```

## Usage

- The plugin works automatically once installed.
- Config values are flexible, allowing for ultra-short or ultra-long days and nights.
